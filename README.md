# CS445 Final Project

The project contains baby generator pipelines implemented using two different kinds of alogrithms:   
a. Triangulation Mesh Warping  
b. Feature-based morphing using `The Baier The Baier-Neely morphing algorithm`

### How to run Triangulation Mesh Warping  
1. run auto alignment with two images `female pic` and `male pic`  
   a. 

9. The final result is stored as output.jpg


### How to run Feature-based morphing
